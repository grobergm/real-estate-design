# Real Estate Design

## Description

This is a responsive landing page design for a fake real estate company. You can view a live version by clicking here. I might add to it later, but for now its just a design.

This was created with the Vue CLI. If you download or clone this repo, you need to run ```npm install``` and then ```npm run serve``` to make it work on your computer.
